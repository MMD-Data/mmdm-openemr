# STRICT EDIT POLICY

1. MAKE ONLY THE SPECIFIC CHANGES REQUESTED IN THE USER QUERY
   - Do not touch ANY other code, even if unfamiliar or seemingly unused
   - Do not "clean up", "improve", or remove ANY code not directly related to the request
   - Leave ALL existing code intact unless explicitly told to modify it

2. When uncertain about any code:
   - Assume it is necessary
   - Do not remove or modify it
   - Ask the user about it rather than making assumptions

3. ANY deletion or modification must be DIRECTLY related to the user's explicit request
